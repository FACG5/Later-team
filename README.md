# Title


#### About:
The basic idea of the site is to write the project's name you want to search for,
after clicking search, the information of all the possible results will be grabbed and
appear as a search results

when you choose any project you want, the page will be updated the project's details which includes:
  1. The project's photo.


### The file structure:
1. index.html "The main page".
2. style.css "page style"
3. index.js and function.js "main and API functions and DOM"

### How ?
1. The user choose the project that he want from the populars projecrs  list to start  watching it's details.
2. When the user type the name of the project in the search text field and choose to search, a request to projects Data base API is sent and the response presents all the matching projects with it's details.
3. when you click on the projects that appeared in the results field the details to the user/owner will appear thats contain 1. First name.
2. Last name.
3. Followers.
4. following.

### Splitting the Work:
   . In the first day we made a sketch of our site and decided the functions and our API's.   
   . Then we started the TDD Part to our functions.
   . Then we started to design the html, dom and API's parts.
   . In the second day we completed the dom and API then made the style of our work.
